## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added
- **Case-insensitive email handling**: Emails are now automatically normalized to lowercase
  - `@validates("email")` decorator on User model ensures consistent storage
  - `@pre_load` hook in UserLoginSchema for case-insensitive login
  - Prevents duplicate registrations with different case variations
  - Users can login with any case: `user@example.com`, `USER@EXAMPLE.COM`, `User@Example.Com`
  - Efficient database queries (uses indexes properly)
- **extend_existing support for User model**: Added `__table_args__ = {"extend_existing": True}`
  - Fixes SQLAlchemy table redefinition errors in function-scoped test fixtures
  - Enables safe module reloading during development
  - Simple inheritance works automatically: `class EmployeeUser(User): ...`
  - Mixin inheritance works automatically: `class CustomUser(User, ProfileMixin): ...`
  - No explicit `__table_args__` needed in subclasses for single-table inheritance

### Changed
- Email storage is now always lowercase in the database
  - Existing installations can optionally run: `UPDATE user SET email = LOWER(email);`
  - Not required but recommended for data consistency

### Fixed
- User model inheritance errors with function-scoped test fixtures
- Case-sensitive email lookup issues in authentication

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- **Automatic ReadTheDocs Updates**: GitHub Actions now automatically trigger documentation builds on each release
- `HasUserMixin.__user_backref_name__` configuration option for customizing User relationship backrefs
  - `None` (default): Auto-generate from tablename (e.g., "articles")
  - Custom string: Use specified name (e.g., "my_posts")
  - Empty string: Skip backref creation entirely
- Comprehensive ReadTheDocs setup guide in `docs/READTHEDOCS_SETUP.md`
- `trigger-docs` job in CI/CD workflow to call ReadTheDocs API
- PDF and EPUB documentation formats in ReadTheDocs configuration

### Changed
- **User Permission Mixins Unified**: Merged `UserCanReadWriteMixin` and `UserOwnedResourceMixin` into single `UserOwnershipMixin`
  - Use `__delegate_to_user__ = False` for simple ownership (default)
  - Use `__delegate_to_user__ = True` to delegate to `user._can_write()`
  - Backwards compatible migration path documented
- Removed unnecessary `__tablename__` declarations across codebase
  - All BaseModel subclasses now use auto-generated table names
  - Updated foreign key references to match auto-generated names
  - Cleaner, more consistent code style

### Fixed
- SQLAlchemy warnings about duplicate `TestModel` class names in tests (renamed to unique names)
- Test models now follow same conventions as production code
- Domain model foreign key updated from "domains.id" to "domain.id"

### Documentation
- Enhanced `HasUserMixin` docstring with backref configuration examples
- Updated all model examples to show auto-generated table names
- Added USER_OWNERSHIP_MIXIN.md guide for migration
- Updated README with prominent ReadTheDocs link
- 5 new tests for backref name configuration

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING CLARIFICATION**: When using dict mode for `methods` parameter in `CRUDBlueprint`, all CRUD methods are now explicitly enabled by default. Previously this behavior was undocumented.
- Simplified README documentation for `methods` parameter, removed `skip_methods` details from main docs
- Enhanced docstrings in `CRUDBlueprint` with comprehensive examples
- Improved error messages with type information in method normalization

### Added
- Warning when both dict `False` and `skip_methods` are used redundantly for the same method
- Comprehensive test suite for `methods` and `skip_methods` logic (11 new tests)
- Documentation file `docs/crud_methods_cleanup.md` explaining method resolution
- GitHub workflows for automated PyPI publishing with Trusted Publishing support

### Fixed
- Empty methods list no longer attempts to register empty MethodView routes
- GenericCRUD route only registered when it has at least one method

## [0.2.1] - 2024-12-21
